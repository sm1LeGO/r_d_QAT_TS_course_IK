# Part related to 11th HomeWork Mocking 

Created new folder 11th HomeWork 
  - Under 11th folder copied part from 9th HomeWork from SRC folder
  - Created folder tests and use 2 services as charging-station and fuel station to run tests
  - install vitest config to launch tests properly 
  - Fix eslint errors
  - Adjust Readme

In addition tried to avoid any declare, but failed unfortunately on rewrited methods still need to declare smth xD Viacheslav or Natalia maybe you can give me hints for future how to avoid 'any' warnings.
