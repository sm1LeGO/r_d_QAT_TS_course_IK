To initiate package json and build TS file used command "npm i"

# 7th HomeWork related to TypeScript basics and Types
7th HomeWork folder contains:

- Under SRC folder created 2 TS files
       - functions.ts & arrow-functions.ts
       - updated ReadMe file

- For arrow-functions.ts used code from lesson 5 provided by Viacheslav (interested in playing with different code)
- For functions.ts used code from my 5thHomeWork/src/functions.js file.
