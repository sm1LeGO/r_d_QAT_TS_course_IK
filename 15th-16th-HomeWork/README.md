# Readme File for 15 & 16 HomeWorks

Since we use same Cases for tests under both HomeWorks decided to combine them under same MR.

For HomeWork created 3 folders >>>
  - Test Cases located under 15th-test-cases
  - Cypress tests are under tests/cypress folder
  - Puppeteer located under tests/puppeteer

All tests frameworks initialized independently using >>> npm i command

Please note that for puppeteer used vitest framework as base

It's initial setup for test cases unfortunately nhl.com was not so easy webSite for me to navigate properly, but tried my best 

Additional note for reviewer, for test cases just use both css selectors and xpath codes, I can write independent cases but idea is understand and hopefully will be counted as done, already wait when we will start to work with PlayWright.
