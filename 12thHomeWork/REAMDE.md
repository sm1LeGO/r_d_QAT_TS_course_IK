# Part related to 12th Homework POSTMAN and API basics

For testing purposes I cloned official-joke-API reposetory, how to install it can be found under ReadMe file in same folder. ( https://lms.robotdreams.cc/course/2479/lesson/45544/homework/24960 )

Added Postman tests collection with json. 

API doesn't allow to work with POST / PATCH / DELETE operators so tests are only for GET requests.
